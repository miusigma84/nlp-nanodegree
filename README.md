# nlp-nanodegree
Natural Language Processing Nanodegree from Udacity Platform

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Natural Language Processing Nanodegree program which I started working on in June 2018.

The Natural Language Processing Nanodegree is an online certification. It involves courses in Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computing with Natural Language and Communication with Natural Language.

Courses include lecture videos, quizzes, programming problems. These courses were developed by IBM Watson and Amazon Alexa.

This directory includes my submission of the mandatory project work for each module in the form of the IPython notebook.

## Program Outline:

### Introduction to Natural Language Processing
* ### Project 1: Parts of Speech Tagging
* Use the Pomegranate Library to build a Hidden Markov Model for part of speech tagging using the Brown Corpus that was already pre-processed to only include the universal tagset.

### Computing with Natural Language
* ### Project 2: Machine Translation from English to French
* Machine translation from English to French using RNNs, RNNs with an embedding layer, Bidirectional RNNs and Encoder-Decoder model.

### Communication with Natural Language
* ### Project 3: DNN Speech Recognizer
* Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline. The completed pipeline  accepts raw audio as input and returns a predicted transcription of the spoken language.
